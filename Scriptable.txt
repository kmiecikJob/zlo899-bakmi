Right now you have easy access to score you can create differents events that increasing score.
You can have varius object that have connection with ScriptableInt, but not necesarly with UI,
or other object that will use score.
Only issue you have to update ui manually (or you can make some delegate/job/action to do it).
Score value is holded through scenes, but going to be deleted on exiting program so it's wort to
have some saving points, exp. public void on Disable(){};


x object  ---> scriptableint ---> y object
                    |
		    |
		z. object 



etc.
